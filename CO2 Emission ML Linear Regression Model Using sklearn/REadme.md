# üöó CO2 Emission Analysis by Vehicles üåç

Welcome to the CO2 Emission Analysis by Vehicles project! üéâ This project focuses on understanding and predicting CO2 emissions from vehicles using data from Kaggle. The goal is to explore the factors influencing vehicle emissions and build models to predict CO2 output based on vehicle characteristics.

## üìä **Project Overview**

This project leverages a dataset that provides information on vehicle types and their corresponding CO2 emissions. The dataset allows for an in-depth analysis of how different vehicle attributes affect CO2 emissions, which can provide insights for policymakers and industry stakeholders looking to reduce carbon footprints.

## About the Dataset

- **Dataset**: CO2 Emissions by Vehicle in Canada
- **Content**: Data on CO2 emissions from vehicles with various attributes.
- **Number of Rows**: 1067
- **Number of Columns**: 12

**Inputs:**

- **Make**: Vehicle make
- **Model**: Vehicle model
- **Vehicle Class**: Vehicle class
- **Engine Size**: Engine size (L)
- **Cylinders**: Number of cylinders
- **Transmission**: Transmission type
- **Fuel Type**: Fuel type
- **Fuel Consumption City**: Fuel consumption in city (L/100 km)
- **Fuel Consumption Hwy**: Fuel consumption on highway (L/100 km)
- **Fuel Consumption Comb (L/100 km)**: Combined fuel consumption (L/100 km)
- **Fuel Consumption Comb (mpg)**: Combined fuel consumption (mpg)
- **CO2 Emissions**: CO2 emissions (g/km)

## The project consists of two main phases:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

- Analyze CO2 Emission Patterns
- Assess the Impact of External Factors
- Feature Engineering

2. **Machine Learning Model**:
   - Simple Linear Regression Model
   - Multiple Linear Regression Model
   - Polynomial Regression Model
  .


## Key Insights and Conclusions:

1. **Fuel Consumption and Emissions**: Higher fuel consumption (L/100 km) directly results in higher CO2 emissions.
2. **Engine Size Impact**: Vehicles with larger engine sizes and more cylinders produce more CO2 emissions.
3. **Fuel Type Differences**: CO2 emissions vary significantly depending on the fuel type used.
4. **Fuel Efficiency (mpg)**: Vehicles with higher miles per gallon (mpg) are more fuel-efficient and emit less CO2.

## üí° **Actionable Recommendations**

### **1. Policy and Regulation**

-   **Promote Fuel Efficiency:** Encourage the development and adoption of fuel-efficient vehicles to reduce overall CO2 emissions. Policies could include incentives for manufacturers and consumers of low-emission vehicles.
-   **Support Alternative Fuels:** Promote the use of alternative fuels such as electricity or hydrogen, which produce lower CO2 emissions compared to traditional fossil fuels.

### **2. Consumer Awareness**

-   **Educate Consumers:** Raise awareness about the environmental impact of vehicle choices. Provide information on how different vehicle attributes and fuel types affect CO2 emissions.
-   **Incentivize Eco-Friendly Choices:** Offer incentives for consumers to choose vehicles with lower CO2 emissions, such as tax rebates or subsidies for electric vehicles.

### **3. Future Research Directions**

-   **Expand Dataset:** Incorporate additional data sources to enhance the analysis, such as real-world driving conditions and fuel consumption metrics.
-   **Advanced Modeling Techniques:** Explore advanced machine learning techniques and ensemble methods to improve prediction accuracy and gain deeper insights into emission patterns.
